# Executor-Framework-Callable

Testing Callable class by computing arithmetic progression with parallel threads.

### The test run data can be found in "testruns.csv"

# Series computed
We computed the series m + (m + d) + (m + 2d) + (m + 3d) + ... + (m + nd) for different values of m, n and d. We started to see some speedup from n >= 10000000.
